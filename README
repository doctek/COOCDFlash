COOCDFlash (pronounced "cooked flash") is created because of my 
strong liking for OpenOCD and desire to help popularize it.

Specifically, COOCDFlash address the need to add flash drivers to
OpenOCD in order to support new chips. Since manufacturers have
little commercial incentive to support OpenOCD, development of
new flash drivers often lags the new chips. COOCDFlash seeks to
provide instruction and examples that will guide the creation of
new flash drivers.

It is important to note that COOCDFlash is not for the newbie user of
OpenOCD. You should be comfortable downloading and installing 
OpenOCD, and should be able to set up your ARM tool chain to do
development on a target system. With this level of skill, you will
find COOCDFlash materials to be useful if you choose to develop a 
flash driver for a new chip.

What you will find at this site are a couple of flash drivers -
one is a copy of the existing stm32x driver found in OpenOCD. I have 
extensively commented it to explain all the necessary and optional
functions and structures that are necessary in a flash driver. The
other is an experimental flash driver for a Nuvoton NUC-120 chip. I
am currently working on the development of this driver and this project
is mostly a result of what I am learning by way of this development
effort.

Please understand that I do not consider myself an OpenOCD or flash
driver expert by any means. I am a serious amateur who is trying to 
learn and is eager to share what I have learned. Please send your
comments, suggestions, and questions to help improve this project.

The COPYING file contains a copy of the GPL as used by the OpenOCD
project. This is the license under which all COOCDFlash material 
is released. I will only change the license if OpenOCD changes the
license they use.
